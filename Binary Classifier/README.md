## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repo**.
2.  **pip install -r requirements.txt**
3.  **Keep the file structure unchanged**: Don't move or rename files/folders; the scripts expect them in their original locations.
4.  **Check model performance**: Run `7_enhanced_predictor.py` → this script shows metrics (accuracy, F1, etc.) on the training data.
5.  **Run predictions**: Run `8_finale.py` → this script loads the trained model and predicts on the contents of `test.csv`, which must be uploaded through the GUI.

**How `test.csv` works**:

  * `test.csv` must contain exactly one row of feature values.
  * It has **15 features** in the correct order, matching the model’s expectations.
  * The first line of the file is the header (feature names). ⚠️ Do not delete or change it.

**Using the example test files**:

  * `test_features_normal.csv` → contains several rows that should predict **Normal (0)**.
  * `test_features_abnormal.csv` → contains several rows that should predict **Abnormal (1)**.

**To test them**:

1.  Open either `test_features_normal.csv` or `test_features_abnormal.csv`.
2.  Copy one full row of feature values.
3.  Open `test.csv`.
4.  Replace the old values with the new ones you copied.
5.  Keep the first header row (feature names) unchanged.
6.  Save `test.csv`.
7.  Run `8_finale.py` again and upload `test.csv` to see the prediction.

*A usage video has also been included to run `8_finale.py`.*
